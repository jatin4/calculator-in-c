🧮 Description of Calculator Program in C Language

The C programming language is a powerful and widely used programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972.
It is known as a structured, procedural, and middle-level language, which provides both low-level (hardware) and high-level (software) capabilities.

In this project, we have used C language to create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

The calculator program uses variables, operators, and a switch-case control structure to perform operations based on the user’s choice.
It also uses input/output functions like printf() and scanf() from the standard input/output library <stdio.h> to interact with the user.

The key concept demonstrated in this program includes:

Taking input from the user

Using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)

Decision making using switch statement

Displaying output based on user input

This calculator program helps beginners understand how logic, control flow, and mathematical operations work together in C.
It is one of the best examples to start learning programming because it covers almost all the basic elements of C language like:

Variables

Data types

Operators

Control statements

Input/Output functions

🧠 In short:

The calculator in C language is a simple program that performs basic arithmetic operations using user input and displays the result. It demonstrates the fundamental building blocks of C programming such as operators, conditional statements, and input/output handling.
🔹 Aim:

To write a program in C language to perform basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

🔹 Objective:

The objective of this program is to create a simple calculator using the C programming language that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding mathematical operation.

🔹 Algorithm:

Start the program.

Declare variables for numbers and operator.

Ask the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).

Ask the user to enter two numbers.

Use a switch statement to perform the operation based on the operator entered.

Display the result.

End the program.

🔹 Output (Examples):
Output 1:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter two numbers: 10 5
Result: 15.00

Output 2:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): -
Enter two numbers: 25 12
Result: 13.00

Output 3:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter two numbers: 6 4
Result: 24.00

Output 4:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter two numbers: 20 4
Result: 5.00

🔹 Conclusion:

This program successfully performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It demonstrates the use of switch statements, arithmetic operators, and user input handling in the C language.

⚙️ Advantages and Disadvantages of Calculator in C Language


✅ Advantages:

Simple and Easy to Understand:
The calculator program in C is very easy to write and understand, especially for beginners learning basic programming concepts.

Fast Execution:
Since C is a compiled language, the calculator executes very quickly compared to interpreted languages.

Low Memory Usage:
C programs use very little memory, making the calculator efficient and lightweight.

Portable:
The program can run on different systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) without major changes in code.

Strong Understanding of Logic:
Writing a calculator helps students learn how to use operators, switch-case statements, and handle user input/output effectively.

Good Foundation for Larger Projects:
This calculator forms the base for understanding how complex applications like scientific or financial calculators can be developed later.

❌ Disadvantages:

Limited Functionality:
The basic calculator only performs simple arithmetic operations. It cannot handle advanced functions like square roots, powers, or trigonometric calculations.

No Graphical Interface:
The calculator runs only in the terminal (console), so it doesn’t have buttons or GUI like modern calculators.

No Error Handling for All Cases:
Although division by zero is handled, other invalid inputs (like alphabets instead of numbers) can still cause errors.

Difficult for Non-Programmers:
Users must run the program through a compiler or terminal, which can be hard for people without programming knowledge.

Static Input:
The calculator only works for two numbers at a time; it can’t handle long mathematical expressions or multiple-step calculations.
