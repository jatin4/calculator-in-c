🧮 Description of Calculator Program in C Language

The C programming language is a powerful and widely used programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972.
It is known as a structured, procedural, and middle-level language, which provides both low-level (hardware) and high-level (software) capabilities.

In this project, we have used C language to create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

The calculator program uses variables, operators, and a switch-case control structure to perform operations based on the user’s choice.
It also uses input/output functions like printf() and scanf() from the standard input/output library <stdio.h> to interact with the user.

The key concept demonstrated in this program includes:

Taking input from the user

Using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)

Decision making using switch statement

Displaying output based on user input

This calculator program helps beginners understand how logic, control flow, and mathematical operations work together in C.
It is one of the best examples to start learning programming because it covers almost all the basic elements of C language like:

Variables

Data types

Operators

Control statements

Input/Output functions

🧠 In short:

The calculator in C language is a simple program that performs basic arithmetic operations using user input and displays the result. It demonstrates the fundamental building blocks of C programming such as operators, conditional statements, and input/output handling.
🔹 Aim:

To write a program in C language to perform basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

🔹 Objective:

The objective of this program is to create a simple calculator using the C programming language that takes two numbers and an operator as input and performs the corresponding mathematical operation.

🔹 Algorithm:

Start the program.

Declare variables for numbers and operator.

Ask the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).

Ask the user to enter two numbers.

Use a switch statement to perform the operation based on the operator entered.

Display the result.

End the program.

🔹 Output (Examples):
Output 1:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter two numbers: 10 5
Result: 15.00

Output 2:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): -
Enter two numbers: 25 12
Result: 13.00

Output 3:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter two numbers: 6 4
Result: 24.00

Output 4:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter two numbers: 20 4
Result: 5.00

🔹 Conclusion:

This program successfully performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It demonstrates the use of switch statements, arithmetic operators, and user input handling in the C language.
