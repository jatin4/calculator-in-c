⚙️ Advantages and Disadvantages of Calculator in C Language
✅ Advantages:

Simple and Easy to Understand:
The calculator program in C is very easy to write and understand, especially for beginners learning basic programming concepts.

Fast Execution:
Since C is a compiled language, the calculator executes very quickly compared to interpreted languages.

Low Memory Usage:
C programs use very little memory, making the calculator efficient and lightweight.

Portable:
The program can run on different systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) without major changes in code.

Strong Understanding of Logic:
Writing a calculator helps students learn how to use operators, switch-case statements, and handle user input/output effectively.

Good Foundation for Larger Projects:
This calculator forms the base for understanding how complex applications like scientific or financial calculators can be developed later.

❌ Disadvantages:

Limited Functionality:
The basic calculator only performs simple arithmetic operations. It cannot handle advanced functions like square roots, powers, or trigonometric calculations.

No Graphical Interface:
The calculator runs only in the terminal (console), so it doesn’t have buttons or GUI like modern calculators.

No Error Handling for All Cases:
Although division by zero is handled, other invalid inputs (like alphabets instead of numbers) can still cause errors.

Difficult for Non-Programmers:
Users must run the program through a compiler or terminal, which can be hard for people without programming knowledge.

Static Input:
The calculator only works for two numbers at a time; it can’t handle long mathematical expressions or multiple-step calculations.
